== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which WordPress user is used to post the lottery results and jackpots? =

You can select the user to use for posting the lottery results when you configure the plugin under the Settings menu. However, the user can only have the Author role. If you do not have any user with the Author role only, please create a new user first before configuring our plugin.

= How many API calls do I need? =

For a weekly lottery game, you will require at least 4 API calls per month to retrieve and display the lottery results. If you lik to further display the lottery jackpot, you will need at least 8 API calls per month.

For a daily game, at least 30 API calls will be needed to show the draw results. To further show the next jackpot, at least 60 API calls will be needed.

= How do I set the number of API calls? =

You do not need to set the number of API calls. You only need to indicate the update frequency under the Settings menu. For example, if you choose to update once every week, our plugin will make 4-5 API calls per month to show the draw results for each selected game.

You can choose as many games as you like. However, a single API call can only retrieve the latest draw results for a single game.

= How do I know how many API calls are made by the plugin? =

You can login to our [API Area](https://www.magayo.com/api/) to view your monthly API usage.

= Why are the lottery results or jackpots not updated? =

The most likely reason is that you have exceeded your API limit. You can check your API usage in our [API Area](https://www.magayo.com/api/) and you may like to consider [upgrading your API plan](https://www.magayo.com/lottery-feeds/wordpress-lottery-plugin/).

If you are sure that you have not exceeded your API limit, you may like to turn on your WordPress debug mode to see if you can identify and resolve the problem. Our WordPress cron job for updating the lottery results will log messages when WordPress is in debug mode.

To turn on the debug mode, you can add the following lines into your wp-config.php file:
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);

When in debug mode, you can check the file /wp-content/debug.log for any errors or messages from our cron job.

Please note that it is not recommended to run WordPress in debug mode for live sites.

Alternatively, you can deactivate and re-activate the plugin.
